![Preview_TypingPractice](./images/previewTypingPractice.png)

Simple Typing practice app.

## Description

This is a simple typing practice tool that helps users improve their typing skills by visually indicating correct and incorrect keystrokes. As users type, the correct letters are highlighted in green, while incorrect ones appear in red. This tool provides immediate feedback, allowing users to focus on accuracy and gradually improve their typing precision. It does not track words per minute (WPM), but instead emphasizes the visual representation of correct and incorrect input, making it ideal for users who want to practice typing accuracy without the pressure of speed.
